<h2> LiftOff + LifeStyle = LiftStyle</h2>


<h3>MySQL database setup:</h3>
<p>In MySQL workbench make a new schema called <code>liftstyle</code><br>
If you need a refresher - https://education.launchcode.org/SQL/chapters/mysql-part-1/exercises.html#exercises-sql-part-1<br>
Then you will want to make a new user, with both a username and password of <code>liftstyle</code><br>
Next head to "Users and Privileges" under the server menu. Give the liftstyle user full access by clicking the DBA checkbox under the Administrative Roles tab. </p>
